	Userauth completed with following minimal features.
		i) 1st it checks wether user have valid username/password combination.
		ii) After successfull username/password validation, it checks the file permission for the given particular user. If everything ok, then it start transfers the file OR else it sends the error to client. (Ex: Err|Permission denied)

Fixed:
	in client.c always file offset is incremented by "MAX_PACKET_SIZE" instead of 'number of received packets'. That's the reason some bytes were missing when file transferring b/w two diff physical systems. It has been rectified in this version and tested with multiple binary files upto maximum filesize of 640MB.
	
Todo:
	i) server sholud handle multiple client requests. Right now its serving only one client at a movement.	
	ii) Userauth has to be improved. for ex it should be able to check file permissions based on username/id and then serve the file to client.

	User Authentication Module implementd successfully with PAM authentication API.
Issues:
	its working fine with localhost. But there is issue in transferring files b/w 2 diff systems.
Todo:
	i) User Authentication has to be improved and it should be able to serve only if user have authentication to retrive that particular file. (Ex:setuid)
	ii) File transfer issue (b/w 2 diff physical computers) has to be fixed in next version itself, since it won't be usualbe unless this bug fixed.
Implement Later:
	Right now it supports only upto 2GB filesize transfer. This has to be fixed later using the following compilation options.
	-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
	
This is the version copied to vikas systems.

	tested with 638MB binary file and its ok. 
Fixed:
	There is logic mistake in FLAG variable setting. Its resolved and file transfer ok.

	Base version is working.
Functionalities:
	Server Listens in port 5000
	Client gives the request with filename as parameter. It received and prints in the screen.

	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
ftp server/client development:
        a) Multi client request should be handled in child process.
        b) USER AUTHENTICATION MODULE HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Transfer timestamp has to be captured and display to client.

KNOWN ISSUES/RESTRICTIONS:
	a) Filename lenght with absolute path should be only upto 512 bytes. (variable declared with 512 max size)
