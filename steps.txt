NOTES:
ftp server/client development:
        a) Multi client request should be handled in child process.
        b) USER AUTHENTICATION MODULE HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
		It should be functional completely. (only user have permission to read has to be transferred.)
	c) Later start implementing the commands one by one.
	d) File size larger than 2GB support has to be implemented and tested.

	


	i) Username validation should be done with priority. Since Username validation has to happen only once, and that particular session should be kept alive still that particular user logging out.
